  <p>HowCrowded provides a dual solution to make it easier
    both for people and organizations to keep social distance.<br><br>
    This is achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Sensors provided to indoor locations accessible by
        the public such as grocery stores, libraries or gyms.</li>
      <li>An app/website that the public can use to check both
        real time how many people are in an indoor location,
        and also general trends so they can plan their visit when
        there is less crowded.</li>
      <li>An app/website that can be used by organizations
        to manage information about how many people are in their
        store at a given time. This can be used for planning and
        organization as well as setting up a screen at the front door
        to control the people going in and out.</li>
      <li>This technology will make it much easier for people
        to plan their visits to indoor public places and ensure that
        they are going there when there is less people around.</li>
      </ul>

   <p class="solution-text-white"> This will make it much easier for people to plan their trips to public
   indoor spaces as they can both check in real-time how many people and
   see how many people that usually visit at given times.</p>

    </p>
   <p class="solution-text-white"> For organizations, they no longer have to count manually how many
    people are in the location, and for smaller stores this could mean
    that they will no longer need to use a member of staff to control
    the door as the customer is told by the screen when it is ready for
    them to go into the space.</p>

   <div class="solution-text">
     <p>Privacy is also highly important for HowCrowded
       and is why sensors are being used to control the
       number of people going in and out without registering
       which people. However for places such as restaurants
       that are required to write who has visited can use the app
       to register visitors too, but this will be saved on their
       local hard drive and not distributed to the HowCrowded
       database.</p>
