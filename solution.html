  <h2>A dual solution</h2>
  <p>HowCrowded provides a dual solution to make it easier
    both for people and organizations to keep social distance.<br><br>
    This is achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Sensors provided to indoor locations accessible by
        the public such as grocery stores, libraries or gyms.</li>
      <li>An app/website that the public can use to check both
        real time how many people are in an indoor location,
        and also general trends so they can plan their visit when
        there is less crowded.</li>
      <li>Technology that can be used by organizations
        to manage information about how many people are in their
        store at a given time. This can be used for planning and
        organization as well as setting up a screen at the front door
        to control the people going in and out.</li>
      </ul>

   <img src="images/consumer.png" alt="consumer" width="auto" height="70">
   <p class="solution-heading">Consumer</p>
   <p class="solution-text-white"> This will make it much easier for people to plan their trips to public
   indoor spaces as they can both check in real-time how many people and
   see how many people that usually visit at given times.</p>

    </p>
   <p class="solution-text-white"> For organizations, they no longer have to count manually how many
    people are in the location, and for smaller stores this could mean
    that they will no longer need to use a member of staff to control
    the door as the customer is told by the screen when it is ready for
    them to go into the space.</p>

     <h2>Differentiating us from our competitors</h2>
     <p>There are similar concepts to the product we are offering.
       Google for example has a function that shows how busy a place
       is, and also does forecasts for different times of the day.
       Furthermore, the technology for using sensors to track people
       going in and out of a store also exicitis, however the practice
       of using these are not widespread. However, the genius
       lies in combining these two services. The stores will better
       manage the flow of customers, because they give the real time
       information to them, and the customers will get an accurate
       number of how many people are in the store at a given time -
       making it easier for them to plan when they are going to a
       certain location.</p>
