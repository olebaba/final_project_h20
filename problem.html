  <h2>The challenge of a global pandemic</h2>

    <p> HowCrowded is working towards handling one
      of the challenges that comes with the COVID-19
      pandemic:<br>
      <i>- Managing to keep distance to other people in
      order to prevent the disease to spread.</i><br>
      Today’s global pandemic has taught us many things.
      It’s made us more aware to wash our hands and perhaps
      most importantly to keep distance from each other.
      WHO (n.d.) states that to keep yourself and others
      safe from COVID-19 it’s important to keep a distance
      of at least one meter from others, and an even greater
      distance when one is indoors. The further away, the better.
      However, it is not always easy to be able to maintain
      distance to other people. Doing necessary chores such
      as going to a grocery store can make it difficult to keep
      distance to the other shoppers if there are too many people
      there at the same time. This is also a big challenge for
      indoor spaces that are open to the public. They need
      regulation to ensure that there are not too many people
      inside the room at the same time: be it a library, grocery
      store or a gym.</p><br>

  <h2 class="problem-text">The challenge illustrated</h2>
  <p class="problem-text">These days many stores and other public spaces have a display
    of how many people are allowed into the store, occasionally
    accompanied by member of staff that checks the numbers.
    However, this is often only displayed by a simple note outside.
    For example for bigger grocery stores where the number might be
    up to 50 people it is difficult to see how many people are actually
    in the store. This put both the customer and the organization’s
    staff at risk of having too many people inside the same space
    at the same time.</p>

      <img src="images/goal.png" alt="Goal number 3" width="200" height="auto" class="text-wrap-left">
      <p>HowCrowded’s work is inspired by the UN’s sustainable goal number 3:
      <br><b><i>Ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.</i></b><br>
      The UN reports that the implications from the pandemic could potentially
      set back decades of improvement in healthcare and they are expecting hundred
      of thousands additional under-5 deaths (UN, n.d.).
      Already, childhood immunization programmes in around 70 countries have been
      interrupted (UN, n.d.). With other words, the pandemic is  threatening
      the health outcomes and could cause massive setbacks to the overall health
      services provided in the world.
      The UN(n.d.) calls out for comprehensive health strategies and increased
      spending on health systems.</p>
